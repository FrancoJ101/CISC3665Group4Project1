# CISC 3665 - Project 1 (Group 4)

## Instructions 
You have been randomly divided into eight groups (five students per group).
Your group has been assigned the following not-very-exciting game:

* **Matching Pennies:**
  - Two-player game both players each have a penny and choose either heads or
    tails. Both players reveal their pennies simultaneously; if they match, player A wins; if they don't, player
    B wins.
  
Create a digital version of your game using Processing. You may assume that two (or more) players are
standing around one computer sharing the monitor and keyboard. Make sure that each player knows when
it is his/her turn. Playtest again after you digitize it! Note: it is highly recommended that you come up
with a working version of your game before programming.

It is not necessary that your revised game have the same operational medium as the original. For example,
you do not have to reproduce the complex game board of Candy Land; obviously, you will not have dice or
coins in your digitized game. You may revise starting with the constitutive rules of your given game.
