CISC 3665 Game Design Group 4 Project 1 Fall 2018

The original game that we need to modify is in the Matching Pennies folder.
Here is the Open Processing Link: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/602915

Improved version: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/605073

## Instructions 

You have been randomly divided into eight groups (five students per group) according to the attached spreadsheet.
Your group has been assigned the following not-very-exciting game:

* **Matching Pennies:**
  
  Two-player game both players each have a penny and choose either heads or
  tails. Both players reveal their pennies simultaneously; if they match, player A wins; if they don't, player
  B wins.
  
### Each group should do the following with the game assigned to them:

1. Is this game considered a "game" according to the definitions we covered in class? Discuss. If the game is
a game according to some definitions but not all, explain both.

2. What makes this game seem "broken"? Why is it not very much fun to play?

3. What are the constitutive rules of the game?

4. How can you make this game more fun? Brainstorm, come up with a revised game, and playtest. Then
brainstorm and revise more as necessary and playtest again!

5. What are the operational rules of your new game? What are the constitutive rules? Which elements of fun
(of the eight that we discussed) did you incorporate?

6. Create a digital version of your game using Processing. You may assume that two (or more) players are
standing around one computer sharing the monitor and keyboard. Make sure that each player knows when
it is his/her turn. Playtest again after you digitize it! Note: it is highly recommended that you come up
with a working version of your game before programming.


It is not necessary that your revised game have the same operational medium as the original. For example,
you do not have to reproduce the complex game board of Candy Land; obviously, you will not have dice or
coins in your digitized game. You may revise starting with the constitutive rules of your given game.




### Your submission should consist of the following:
* A PDF document (no other file formats will be accepted) with written answers to questions 1 - 3 and 5.
The document should also contain a brief description of your brainstorming/creation process and insights
gleaned from playtesting (e.g. "Initially, we planned to do X but when we played it, we realized that Y
would be better . . . ")

* Your digital game posted on OpenProcessing and a file / zipped folder of your code. Make sure that the
directions are included!
